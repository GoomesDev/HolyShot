<h2>Project Description</h2>
With the premise of being a complement to my girlfriend's university design project, where students had to take photos and place them in an image bank app, the idea for HolyShot was born as a way to help them with this task, and consequently study React Native.

<h2>Functionalities</h2>
The application allows the user to select photos from the gallery and save them in a specific directory, accessible only through the app, in polaroid format with a customized description.
In addition, basic functions such as erasing the image.

<h2>Tecnologies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>React Native;</li>
  <li>Expo Lib's.</li>
</ul>
